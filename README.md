## Background
PyBank: Creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company

![revenue-per-lead](https://github.com/vivsarraf/python-challenge/assets/135401654/91614b37-8881-4072-a673-c8cca436ceec)

## Instructions
Create a python script to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

 * The total number of months included in the dataset

 * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

 * The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

 * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

 * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
Your analysis should align with the following results:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)

PyPoll: Creating a Python script to analyze the election results of a small, rural town to modernize its vote-counting process.

## Other Considerations:
We are provided with a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

## Getting Started
Create a new repository for this project called pythonchallenge. 
Clone the new repository to your computer.

Inside your local Git repository, create a folder for each Python assignment and name them PyBank and PyPoll.

In each folder that you just created, add the following content:

A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.

A Resources folder that contains the CSV files you used. Make sure that your script has the correct path to the CSV file.

An analysis folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.

Push these changes to GitHub or GitLab.

## Submission
All three of the following are uploaded to GitHub/GitLab:
* Screenshots of the results
* Separate VBA script files 
* README file
