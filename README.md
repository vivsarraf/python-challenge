# PyBank & PyPoll Challenge

# Background
In this assignment, we will create Python scripts to analyze the financial records of a company and also analyze the election results of a small, rural town to modernize its vote-counting process.

## PyBank
![revenue-per-lead](https://github.com/vivsarraf/python-challenge/assets/135401654/91614b37-8881-4072-a673-c8cca436ceec)

## Instructions
Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

 * The total number of months included in the dataset

 * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

 * The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

 * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

 * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

Create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

 * The total number of votes cast

 * A complete list of candidates who received votes

 * The percentage of votes each candidate won

 * The total number of votes each candidate won

 * The winner of the election based on the popular vote

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## Submission
 * Create a new repository for this project called python-challenge. 
 * Clone the new repository to your computer.
 * Inside your local Git repository, create a folder for each Python assignment and name them PyBank and PyPoll.
 * In each folder that you just created, add the following content:
 * A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
 * A Resources folder that contains the CSV files you used. Make sure that your script has the correct path to the CSV file.
 * An analysis folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.

Push these changes to GitHub or GitLab.
